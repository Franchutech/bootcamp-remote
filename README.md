# 🚀 Bootcamp Remote — Portfolio & Learning Journey  

This repository documents my **5-week personal bootcamp**, focused on building a **job-ready junior profile** for roles in **Data, Automation, and Backend basics**.  

It combines **Python, SQL, APIs, Excel/Power Query, and Power BI**, with step-by-step projects and full documentation.

- Build a strong public portfolio on GitHub.  
- Practice a professional workflow (VS Code + Git + GitHub + WSL).  
- Create reproducible projects with clear documentation.  
- Achieve a competitive level for **remote junior data roles**.
